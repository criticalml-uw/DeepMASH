# DeepNASH:  Competing Risk Neural Network Model to Forecast NASH Patient Trajectories on the Liver Transplant Waitlist
DeepNASH has been trained using SRTR data of NASH patients at the time of listing and the DeepHit model structure to predict the monthly risk of dying on the death and receiving a liver transplant. 

## Models and Data 


## Streamlit Dashboard
The model has been implemented in Streamlit with the function of downloading data templates, uploading patient data as \textit{.csv} files, and visualize the trend of risks.
